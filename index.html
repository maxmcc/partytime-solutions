                    The <strong>Steiner &amp; Co.</strong> art gallery, which is definitely a real
                    thing that exists, will host an opening party on Saturday the <strong>16th of
                        April</strong> 2022 at <strong>6pm</strong>. The gallery will showcase
                    <strong>custom artwork</strong> from a range of talented artists attending the
                    event (including you). Guests will participate in a <strong>silent
                        auction</strong> and will bid for the opportunity to bring home one of the
                    items on display, with all auction proceeds donated to charity.

                        strongly prefer that all invitees challenge themselves to produce some piece
                        of art and donate it to our auction, no matter their skill level.

                        with you. Artistic collaboration with other attendees of the event is
                        perfectly acceptable.

                        to send a copy of the digital originals to the purchaser in addition to the
